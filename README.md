Sweat Roulette
==============

A healthy project by @marcusmichaels and @beingcharlotte.

Sweat Roulette is aimed to get you up and moving with the click of a button.

A workout anywhere, HIIT style web app, developed for us whilst travelling to stay fit without the need of equipment.

Feedback and pull requests are very welcome - here's the functionality we're working on adding next:

- Timer
- Exercise Instructions (likely to be animated GIF images)
- Rest Intervals after every one or two exercises
- Music Player (already part developed and working on Desktop but not Mobile. Music usage has been kindly granted by @fantomenk)
